      <h1> Who We Are:</h1>
Heart to Heart is a Non-Profit organization that offers counseling in Flanagan and Bloomington for these communities and surrounding areas. The agency founder, Sandy Egle, had a special heart and passion for supporting & encouraging those individuals who were "falling through the cracks" of the established social service system due to their economic status. Sandy was well aware of the fact that many people were financially "over qualified" for special services, but yet not financially stable enough to be able to access the services at the current fee levels of $100 - $130 per session.  With these individuals in mind, Heart to Heart Support Services, N.F.P. was established
