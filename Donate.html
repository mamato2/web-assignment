<p>
<p>We are a not for profit Christian counseling service operating out of Flanagan Illinois and Bloomington-Normal Illinois.</p> 
<br>
<p>Heart to Heart works to fill the gap where state funded mental health support stops and where insurance and the ability to pay out-of-pocket for services begins.</p>
 <br>
 <p>We at Heart to Heart believe that everyone deserves quality mental health care regardless of income or ability to pay. Our missionary counselors raise their salaries through fundraising, and our volunteers give their time and skills freely.</p>
<br>
<p> We ask for donations to cover our basic operational needs such as office space, utility bills, and office supply needs. We count on the God-prompted support from those in our community to be the hands of God to support our ministry.</p>
